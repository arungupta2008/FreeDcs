Introduction:
=================

Hello and thanks for your interest in FreeDCS !

FreeDCS is an Open Source effort of individuals all over the world to make a great 
Distributed Control System that's if fully capable of running control algorithms programmed
in a graphical environment.

Those control algorithms are individually compiled in single tasks and sent to a
board computer (from now on, controller) and executed in an RTOS environment.

This package contains the build environment for the controller and is mainly targeted to developers
working on improving the controller code.

Please continue reading to know more about the directory layout used and how to launch the build scripts.

Thanks for helping us !
The FreeDCS team.



Directory layout:
=================

build:
	This dir contains the buildroot build environment. It's a set of scripts that will generate a linux
	kernel with all the tools needed as well as the toolchain for the selected architecture and then compile
	everything to generate a rootfs.img file.
	That file will be the one you load to your target controller or will 
	be used to generate a vmware image if you state that when launching the build_all.sh script.

common:
	Contains configuration files for various architectures to be used by buildroot and the linux kernel config.

freedcs-code:
	At firts this dir will not exist, it will be downloaded from the project website to be as current as possible
	When it's downloaded for the first time, then it will not be downloaded again as long as the dir exists.
	This is to protect the developer if he/she makes changes to the code and this script could overwrite it 
	with a default project when the script is launched.

vm_controller:
	This dir contains the configuration file for vmware player. If the developer launches the build_all.sh
	script indicating that he/she wants to generate a vmware image, it will be located here once built.
	The "vmwarecontroller.vmx" file could be used to launch the vm.


How to launch the build script:
================================

sudo build_all.sh

This script will:
- Ask for options to generate your Controller Build Environment.
- Download if not already downloaded all the packages to build the rootfs.
- Generate a rootfs and vmware image if told to so so, with IP address specified or DHCP
- The toolchain will be generated for ARM or x86 CPU's as requested.
- The code for the controller will be downloaded from the project's website and compiled.
- The binaries will be copied to the /home/freedcs of the target board or vmware image.
- Later on you could update the binaries to the controller via ssh if you make changes to the code and compile again.
