FreeDCS is an Open Source Distributed Control System that is currently in the design phase. It will allow to control any process, machine or equipment reading values from instruments through industry standards (4-20mA, digital IO, etc..) and perform a control strategy with that information to maintain the final product into the specification. It could be used in any manufacturing facility to automate processes or in any project you want to control some machinery or equipement.

The main purpose of FreeDCS is to be an option to other commercial, closed source Distributed Control Systems. Because FreeDCS will be released under a GPL license, users will have a lot of benefits imposible to get with a closed source design.

A trully open system:
Being open means that the project is open to everyone to look under the hood and see how things are done. That makes the task of correcting bugs more easy and fast as well as helping the system evolve quickly. But it also means that the project will never die!. So, if you install the system in a company there will be always someone willing to give technical support if needed.

Flexibility:
Flexibility is important too. FreeDCS is being designed to be used as a single computer system or distributed along various computers in an industrial network. The idea is to use it to control a simple machine with a couple of IO's or a whole plant with +50.000 IO's

Robustness:
Nobody wants to use a system that fails and behaves erratically. So, FreeDCS will be tested exaustivelly by the user comunity to behave as espected in all the ocations.
