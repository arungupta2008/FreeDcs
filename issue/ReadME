Known Issues 


If GCC get's Failed

texinfo 5.0. Version 

Our GCC is old and it expects textinfo version 4.13b to get installed. Ubuntu(13.04) comes with texinfo 4.13b but upcoming versions of Ubuntu will be having the 5.0.1 < versions.
So our creation of disk will get failed.

Solutions 

1. Downgrade the texinfo which is installed in our machine. 
2. Use the patch when system get fails. (010-documentation.patch)  https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/35807
3. Make a virtual environment. (Using Docker i am working on it learning things)







goto  /home/arun/freedcs/build/i386/buildroot-2011.11/output/build

Failed (http://gnu-autoconf.7623.n7.nabble.com/compile-error-conftest-c-14625-must-be-after-defmac-to-use-defmacx-td18843.html)
In host-autoconf due to texinfo added patch (autocong.texi.2.65.patch)






/home/arun/freedcs/build/i386/buildroot-2011.11/output/build/host-m4-1.4.15/lib/


Failed 
./stdio.h:456:1: error: 'gets' undeclared here (not in a function)
 _GL_WARN_ON_USE (gets, "gets is a security hole - use fgets instead");

Please comment on that line then there will be no problem.
